                        <h1 class="display-5 fw-card mb-4 ">Aspirations</h1>
                        <p>
                            In a world ever-increasingly defined by quantity over quality, 
                            I aspire to create meaningful software that can inspire others and promote the well-being of society. 
                            As an aspiring Software Engineer, I understand and promote the idea of prototyping and analysing ideas
                            before they're turned into code, as it leads to better written and performing programs with greater maintainability.
                            For me, rewriting software is never <i>not</i> an option: If something isn't working, I at least consider 
                            rewriting it completely, making it more future-proof and expandable (you can only take the same car to the mechanic
                            so many times before it justifies buying a new car).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the information age, it's easy to come across bad pieces of advice, and developers need to
                            be able to separate what works from what doesn't (not all StackOverflow posts will be able to resolve your
                            problems, especially when your problem is derived from a lack of understanding of how the environment
                            your programing in works). To me, being a developer isn't about being able to program in a specific language, but in a 
                            specific paradigm: Coding in ASP.Net won't make one a better Spring Boot programmer,
                            but understanding how the Model-View-Controller design pattern works makes it easier to learn the 
                            specific syntax of what will be tackled (that being not only the aforementioned languages but many others), 
                            usually taking a couple of days. However, developers usually seem
                            eager to brag about the number of different programming languages they have used in the past, rather than focus 
                            on the different <i>types of projects</i> they have worked on before, which is what usually forces them to think outside
                            the box.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It's not uncommon to find developers stuck for several days in completely avoidable situations if the software had been better
                            designed; And this is where the prototyping (Software Engineering) comes in. Time "lost" in
                            prototyping, modelling, and designing the software is often translated into time "gained" in its developing stage, and although hard
                            for some to comprehend, that is exactly my <i>modus operandi</i> (way of doing things).
